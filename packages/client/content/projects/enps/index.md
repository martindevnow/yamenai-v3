Confidence Rating is used at Thrillworks. I've dealt with eNPS. Simple data is better than no data.

## Problem?

- how do we know everyone knows what they should be doing
- how do we know everyone knows the goal of the project/company
- how do we know that they know they are working towards it?

Truth is, we don't. We might think we do, but we don't

## Megaphone

When given a voice, people will use it.
Show them that you care about what they have to say.

talk about stop chip?

## Data

Trends help identify problems early.
There are always warning signs before danger, we're just sometimes too distracted to see them. This can help put a spotlight on whatever metric you choose to track.

> What gets measured gets managed

## Results

- time will tell
- just starting
-

## My goals

- learn about slack api and building a slackbot
- learn more about OAuth2
- experiment with Slack Bolt
- leverage google cloud functions (Firebase functions)

As a side benefit, discovered how to easily connect github to slack to get notifications of PRs in our slack too

## Learnings

- commit often (i use save on blur, so git is my save history)
- when I get working code, I should make a commit to save that version before refactoring
- refactoring early and often is a good approach. prevents too much complexity build up before starting to refactor

## Conclusion
